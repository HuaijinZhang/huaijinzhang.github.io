## About Me
I'm a PhD student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My research interest includes LoRa technology and underground communication.
I am advised by **Prof. Tao Jiang** (IEEE Fellow) from School of Electronic Information and Communications, HUST. 

## Education
+ Visiting student, in the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, hosted by [Prof. Shaodan Ma](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/shaodanma/), Dec. 2021 - Mar. 2022
+ PhD in Information and Communication Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, Hubei, China, Sep. 2019 - now  
+ Bachelor in Electronic and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, Hubei, China, Sep. 2015 - Jul. 2019

## Under Review
